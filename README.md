# Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning

The repository contains three group final projects and weekly exercises prepared during the academic course [FYS-STK4155 - Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK4155/index-eng.html), taught in the fall semester 2023/24 at the [University of Oslo (UiO)](https://www.uio.no/english/).

*Authors of projects and exercises:* [Alicja K. Terelak](https://github.com/aterelak), [Giorgio Chiro](https://github.uio.no/giorgich), [Eyyüb Güven](https://github.com/curiousbrutus)

### The course has two central parts

1. Statistical analysis and optimization of data
2. Machine learning algorithms and Deep Learning


#### Statistical analysis and optimization of data

The following topics are normally be covered
- Basic concepts, expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
- Simpler models, binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, simple and multivariate normal distributions;
- Central elements of Bayesian statistics and modeling;
- Gradient methods for data optimization, 
- Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings sampling;
- Estimation of errors and resampling techniques such as the cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its mathematical foundation

#### Machine learning

The following topics are typically  covered:
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression;
- Neural networks and deep learning, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks
- Decisions trees, Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting
- Support vector machines
- Bayesian linear and logistic regression
- Boltzmann Machines and generative models
- Unsupervised learning Dimensionality reduction, PCA, k-means and  clustering
- Autoenconders
- Generative algorithms

Hands-on demonstrations, exercises and projects aim at deepening your understanding of these topics.

Computational aspects play a central role and you are expected to work
on numerical examples and projects which illustrate the theory and
various algorithms discussed during the lectures.
